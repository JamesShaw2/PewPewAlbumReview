      <p> Just another little tester. Album pictures will go here, probably be in block elements so they all conform to one shape.</p>

         <p>Alright, Cosmic Egg of Wolfmother. This is an interesting review for me, as I am a huge Wolfmother fan, but as any Wolfmother fan would know, this is their second album. It may not seem like a big deal that this is the second
            album, but the original members of Wolfmother disbanded after the first album. The first album, Wolfmother (self titled) was phenomenal, but it will have it's own review later. The context is important to know about this album, as it
            tends to have the unreasonable critique that comes with a line up change in bands. I want to say that although I started off as a line-up snob, this album is amazing. It holds the same power in it's 80's-esk sound that the first album
            had, but a larger variety of songs that show case the current line up's specialty. From an on point keyboard preformance, to a wider range of the singer's vocals, this albums may not be better than the first, but with songs like "Sundial" and "10000 feet", 
            this album holds it's ground as a powerful rock album that will hold it's place amongst some of the most impressive in the genere.
