         <h1>First Draft</h1>
         <p> This is the first draft of the website. Unfortunately, I didn't start my webpage soon enough, and as such I've created this horrid, unfinished abomination of a site that doesn't have much to do with my content.</p>
         <p> A big part of this is that rather than focus on creating my draft around the learning objectives, I needed to make it for the learning objectives. So things coming up: The huge MS paint picture I made on the home page will 
            be more like a banner, and is a place holder for a more... music oriented image. The homepage is real cluttered, but it had some organization before I read the learning objectives. The homepage has become a rough draft of what is to come
            and will be cleaned up after this assignment is submitted.

         <h1> Second Draft - V2</h1>
         <p>Alright, so in this draft we've come to a *slightly funtional website, with a simple layout and 
            plenty of basis to start adding actual reviews and such. I need to decide on a color scheme and make an mspaint drawing of that so that theres color cohesion
            throughout this page. But yeah, the nav bar is arranged, the secondary nav bar is sketched out, and I think I have a handle on the current material to clean this mess up into something usable.

         <h1>Third Draft</h1>
         <p>I don't know if I've ever expirenced such frustration as setting up a mobile layout, or rearranging all the table columns, but this was the first step into making the actual site
            that has real reviews, album art, etc. The reviews were actually setup this week, but after the various css changes the album pages were nuked and unreadable, so next week will be dedicated to fixing up the pages
            and having around 12 or so albums fleshed out. The table made this possible, as my prior set ups for the albums were horrendous, hence the wait for anything music related. So next project should have plenty of albums covered.
            Also, today is 5/21/19, my name is James, and this is for CIS155.

         <h1>Fourth Draft</h1>
         <p>Im choosing to stick with last version's color scheme as it's easier on the eyes, and matchs the dark-theme webpage. Alright, so this week, I added a submission page for requests, and an actual album review page.
            I put quite a bit of work into 12 or so album reviews, but I quickly became overwhelmed with all the different pages I would have to validate and link, and format with css, so I ended up just linking a single review.
            It was a little lack luster, but it shows the premise of the review page having both a video of the song, as well as an audio clip. This would allow the user to hear for themselves what I would be talking about in the review.
            I feel bad about hyping up all the reviews, but given how this is a graded assignment, I didn't want to risk losing points trying to book up 10 extra pages with unique css functions. I wish I had setup everything so it had been
            easier to add pages, but the end is the end. One day I'm sure I'll come back an make a decent website of this, but for now it will remain a skeleton project.
